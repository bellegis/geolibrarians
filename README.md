These Core Competencies outline and articulate the special skills needed to provide high- quality professional support to users of cartographic and geospatial materials. 


Core Competencies for Map, GIS and Cartographic Cataloging/Metadata Librarians, https://alair.ala.org/bitstream/handle/11213/10961/MAGIRT%20CoreComp_2018_ALAconnect.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y, The charge of the MAGIRT Core Competencies Task Force is to create core competency standards for the map and Geographic information systems (GIS) professions. The resulting document identifies the fundamental knowledge, behaviors, and skills currently essential to most professional positions within the map/GIS information field. It is intended to be a flexible document that can be revised as the field evolves and changes.
